that:
Thomas Viejo, born on June 27, 2001 in Schoelcher (France)
obtained the grades detailed below as of December 04, 2024.
This certificate is delivered upon request for all legal intents and purposes.
Selected in: February 2024

Curriculum ended on: -
Founded in 2013, 42 is a worldwide network of ICT schools. We are a non-traditional educator offering high-quality and scalable software
engineering education to anyone who wants to learn.
It is our mission to prepare the next generation for the jobs of today and tomorrow. We do so using an innovative educational model, which
relies on peer-to-peer learning, project-based and hands-on approach to programming. Our innovative model, allowing individual pace and
path, has proven that our students become industry-ready software engineers within 2 to 5 years.
The progression of the student inside the curriculum is represented by its level, over 21.
The current level of the student is: 11.44.
The 42 curriculum is divided into two halves: the common core and the 42 advanced part. Once students complete the first half (the common
core), they have the option to either continue their journey in the 42 advanced part, or conclude their progression and become an alumni at
any point during this second part.
The current situation of the student is: in the 42 advanced part.

DETAILS
Here is a description of each part of the curriculum and the current position of the student:
The Common Core
The common core of the 42 curriculum represents the minimum set of skills to be ready for a first professional experience. It provides basic
and standard coding skills, as well as a fruitful range of soft skills. The delay of the CC is approximately between 1 and 2 years. The
following information represent the skills developed during this part of the curriculum and the current progression of the student:
Thomas Viejo : Common core achieved at: 100%.
Developed skills during the entire common core:
Algorithms & AI: Standards algorithms on standards structures: searching, sorting, insertion, deletion, balance, on: arrays, linked
lists, trees. State machine and asynchronous management.
Graphics: Image management, RGB structure of an image, manipulating areas, drawing into an image, interacting with the window
management system and getting user events and inputs from keyboard and mouse, programming with callbacks and event loop.
Group & interpersonal: Collaboration, relationships and group management situations, including different kinds of interactions
between people (friendly, tensions ...)
Imperative programming: Basics of coding in C : the C syntax, variable, loops, conditional branches, functions, recursivity,
instructions, calculus and expressions, comparisons operators, standard and advanced types, strings processing, structures, includes
and libraries, memory allocation and release, linked lists, trees, the C standard library

Object-oriented programming: Object programming principles in C++, classes, namespaces, constructors and destructors,
memory management in C++, inheritance, abstraction, overloading, templates, standard C++ library types and tools
Rigor: The need to fulfill administrative and technical constraints. The need for a wide and deep testing process to eliminate failure.
System programming: Classic Unix system interactions : system calls, Alesystem access and management, process creation,
execution, management; inter-process communications : pipes and signals; device management and ioctl, terminal capabilities;
network communication : TCP & UDP sockets, DNS resolution, endianness
Web: The client-server architecture involved in the web, role and actions of the web server, role and actions of the web browser; The
HTTP protocol; Web technologies involved : HTML, CSS, Javascript, images and videos; Backend language and framework for
dynamic websites: one among php, ruby, python, go, javascript, Rails, Symfony, Django, Node, ... ; MVC model; users web services :
web sessions, authentiAcation, cookies, search, caddie, backofAce conAguration, ... ; Basics of user experience, user interface, and

Description of each covered project:
Name Description
Libft This project is your very first project as a student at 42. You will need to recode a few functions of the C standard library as
well as some other utility functions that you will use during your whole cursus.
ft_printf This project is pretty straightforward, you have to recode printf. You will learn what is and how to implement variadic
functions. Once you validate it, you will reuse this function in your future projects.
Exam Rank 02
FdF All programs that you wrote until now were executed in text mode on your terminal. Now, let’s discover something more
exciting: how to open a graphics window and draw inside? To start your journey in graphic programming, FdF offers to
represent “iron wire” meshing in 3D.
push_swap This project involves sorting data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, and the smallest number of moves. To make
this happen, you will have to manipulate various sorting algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution(s) for
optimized data sorting.
pipex This project aims to deepen your understanding of the two concepts that you already know: Redirections and Pipes. It is an
introductory project for the bigger UNIX projects that will appear later on in the cursus.

get_next_line May it be a file, stdin, or even later a network connection, you will always need a way to read content line by line. It is time
to start working on this function, which will be essential for your future projects.
Exam Rank 03
Born2beroot This project aims to introduce you to the wonderful world of virtualization.
Philosophers This project aims to teach concurrent programming, focusing on multithreading and multiprocessing.
minishell The objective of this project is for you to create a simple shell.
Exam Rank 04
CPP Module 00 This first module of C++ is designed to help you understand the specifities of the language when compared to C. Time to
dive into Object Oriented Programming!
CPP Module 01 This module is designed to help you understand the memory allocation, reference, pointers to members and the usage of the
switch in CPP.
CPP Module 02 This module is designed to help you understand Ad-hoc polymorphism, overloads and orthodox canonical classes in CPP.
CPP Module 03 This module is designed to help you understand Inheritance in CPP.
CPP Module 04 This module is designed to help you understand Subtype polymorphism, abstract classes and interfaces in CPP.
NetPractice NetPractice is a general practical exercise to let you discover networking.
cub3d This project is inspired by the world-famous eponymous 90's game, which was the first FPS ever. It will enable you to
explore ray-casting. Your goal will be to make a dynamic view inside a maze, in which you'll have to find your way.
CPP Module 05 This module is designed to help you understand Try/Catch and Exceptions in CPP.
CPP Module 06 This module is designed to help you understand the different casts in CPP.
CPP Module 07 This module is designed to help you understand Templates in CPP.
CPP Module 08 This module is designed to help you understand templated containers, iterators and algorithms in CPP.
CPP Module 09 This module is designed to help you understand the containers in CPP.
Exam Rank 05
Inception This project aims to broaden your knowledge of system administration by using Docker. You will virtualize several Docker
images, creating them in your new personal virtual machine.
webserv This project is here to make you write your own HTTP server. You will be able to test it with a real browser. HTTP is one of
the most used protocol on internet. Knowing its arcane will be useful, even if you won't be working on a website.
ft_transcendence This project is centered around the design, development, and organization of a full-stack web application.
